Hello and welcome to the GitHub repository for our data extraction model!
Our model is designed to extract data about a certain disease from medical text. We have trained and tested our model using a specific dataset.
To use our data extraction model, you can clone this repository and run the relevant scripts to train, test, and apply the model to your own medical text data. We have included detailed instructions in the repository's documentation, along with sample code and examples to help you get started.
Please note that our model is designed for a specific disease and may not be suitable for other diseases or medical conditions. Also, the accuracy and effectiveness of the model may vary depending on the quality and complexity of the input data.
If you have any questions or feedback about our model or dataset, please feel free to open an issue or contact us directly. We appreciate your interest in our work and hope that it can be useful in your own research or applications.
